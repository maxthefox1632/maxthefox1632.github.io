   <h2>February 14th, 2023:</h2>
   <p>This day the website was created. It only had the home page and a 'secret' page (the 'secret' page still exists).</p>
   <br>
   <h2>February 19th, 2023:</h2>
   <p>I added a page listing programs for older operating systems and download links to them. In the beginning I added two programs for Windows Vista (Firefox and Chrome).</p>
   <p>I also slightly updated the home page to add a link to the new page.</p>
   <br>
